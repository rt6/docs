# UBUNTU 16.04 LTS (XENIAL XERUS)

### Package Management (apt)
Ubuntu 16.04 introduced apt to replace apt-get.  It now has a download progress bar :smile:
```sh
# Get new packages
$ sudo apt update

# List packages that need to be updated
$ sudo apt list --upgradeable

# Download and install new packages
$ sudo apt upgrade
```
